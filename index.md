title: "Margaret Cavendish: Philosophical and Physical Opinions, 1663 edition"
---
Margaret Cavendish (1623-1673) wrote numerous works of philosophy, plays, and poetry, as well as a science fiction work, an autobiography and a biography of her husband. While many of her works are available online, her 1663 edition of *Philosophical and Physical Opinions* has not yet had an open access and easily searchable edition until now.

This open access, searchable version of Margaret Cavendish's 1663 edition of *Philosophical and Physical Opinions* is the first version of this text to be hand transcribed and available to the public. The text was transcribed by 70+ participants in a transcribe-a-thon in the Fall of 2019. The final product was proofread and edited by Marcy Lascano.
