## About the Project  
  
Margaret Cavendish (1623-1673) wrote numerous works of philosophy, plays, and poetry, as well as a science fiction work, an autobiography and a biography of her husband. While many of her works are available online, her 1663 edition of *Philosophical and Physical Opinions* has not yet had an open access and easily searchable edition until now. The work is important in that is it a substantial revision of her 1655 edition of *Philosophical and Physical Opinions*. The 1655 edition was a mere 174 pages, while the revised and expanded 1663 edition comes in at 510 pages including the unpaginated prefaces and index.  
  
Given the growing interest in Cavendish's philosophical works by  early modern scholars, it seemed it was time to make this work more widely available. It was clear that we needed to hand transcribe the work, but its length was too much for a small group to undertake. Thus, we decided to get help from the community by hosting a transcribe-a-thon on September 27, 2019. With support from [KU Institute for Research in the Digital Humanities](http://idrh.ku.edu), [KU Libraries](http://lib.ku.edu), and the KU [Philosophy Department](http://philosophy.ku.edu), as well as over 70 transcribers from around the world, the text was completely transcribed by October 4th, 2019.   
  
We used a website built by Brian Rosenblum from KU IRDH to make manuscript pages available to anyone who wanted to transcribe and a simple markdown language in order to make the final text available as a minimal edition in Ed.[^n]
  
In transcribing the text, we decided to ignore most of the elements that were due to features of the printing of the book (such as running headers and hyphenations at the margins, catch words were ignored except when hyphenated), but the one feature of the book we did maintain was the pagination as this is valuable to scholars and students. We maintained the features of the text as written by Cavendish in that we followed Cavendish's spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.  We added notes to document Cavendish's corrections in the text as noted in the Errata.

## Acknowledgments   
  
This open access, searchable version of Margaret Cavendish's 1663 edition of *Philosophical and Physical Opinions* is the first version of this text to be hand transcribed and available to the public. The text was transcribed by 70+ participants in a transcribe-a-thon in the Fall of 2019. The final product was proofread and edited by Marcy Lascano.   
  
This project was made possible by the generous support of the University of Kansas Philosophy Department and Institute for Research in the Digital Humanities. Special thanks goes to Brian Rosenblum for setting up the transcription site and the final Ed. site, as well as providing other technical guidance and expertise. In addition, a debt of gratitude goes to Rachel Henderson, the project research assistant, who worked tirelessly on various aspects of the project, and to David Tamez in IRDH who helped with the transcribe-a-thon. Finally, thank you to all the transcribers who put in their time to help make this text available:
